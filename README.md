Welcome to my Data Analyst Project Portfolio! In this repository, you'll find a detailed analysis of a business dataset focused on the performance of a leading hotel booking website in 2019. This project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of key metrics, business insights, and data-driven recommendations for a fictitious company "Company X" and its hotel booking website "ABC".

•	**Business Performance:** Evaluating the performance of three advertisers (A, B, C) on the ABC platform, considering metrics like clicks, costs, bookings, and booking revenue.

•	**Conversion Rates:** Identifying the conversion trends throughout the year, highlighting factors that affect these rates, and determining how advertisers respond to market trends.

•	**Marketing Strategies:** Providing recommendations for effective marketing strategies based on the data analysis.
